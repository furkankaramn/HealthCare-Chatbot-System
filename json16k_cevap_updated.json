        "Question": "What causes urinary tract infections?",
        "Answers": [
          "Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, primarily Escherichia coli, which enter the urinary tract and multiply, leading to infection.",
          "The main cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is the invasion of bacteria into the urinary tract. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common bacterium responsible for UTIs, as it naturally resides in the intestines and can easily enter the urinary tract.",
          "Bacteria typically enter the urinary tract through the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside. From there, they can ascend into the bladder and, in more severe cases, reach the kidneys.",
          "Certain factors increase the risk of developing a UTI. These include female anatomy, as women have a shorter urethra, making it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder. Sexual activity can also introduce bacteria into the urethra. The use of certain birth control methods, such as diaphragms or spermicides, can contribute to UTIs as well. Urinary tract abnormalities and conditions that weaken the immune system can also increase susceptibility to UTIs.",
          "While bacteria, particularly E. coli, are the primary cause of UTIs, its worth noting that UTIs can also be caused by other microorganisms, such as viruses and fungi. However, bacterial infections are the most common.",
          "The body has defense mechanisms that help prevent UTIs. The immune system, natural flushing action of urine, and the protective lining of the urinary tract all work together to inhibit bacterial growth and prevent infection.",
          "In conclusion, urinary tract infections are primarily caused by the invasion and multiplication of bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, within the urinary tract.
